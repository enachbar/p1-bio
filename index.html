			Hi there! My name is Emily and I am 20 years old. 
			Currently at Eastern Washington University, in my junior year, 
			I am studying Visual Communication Design with a minor in Art. 
			In this vigorous program, I am learning and perfecting my 
			skills in design and photography with a focus on branding and 
			marketing for print and web design.

<div class="pro">Professional Objectives 

	<p class= "obj1">As a student, I am very eager and excited to enter the world of design. Design has a huge impact on the world around us.  It influences us everywhere we go, whether we know it or not. To be a part of the world that makes an impact is very exciting to me. Being involved and influential in my work as designer is especially important to me.</p>
